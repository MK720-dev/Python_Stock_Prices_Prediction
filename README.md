In the **regression** folder, there are two main source code files:
  * StockPrediction.py
  * LinearRegressionAlgorithm.py

### <ins>StockPrediction.py</ins>

In this program, I used a scikit-learn Linear Regression model to predict Google Stock prices. 

#### Dataset:
I used python's **Quandl** module to import a real life **Google Stock prices** dataset from the core financial datasets on the **Nasdaq Data Link** website. 
The dataset contains Google stock prices from **08-19-2004** up to **03-27-2018** 

For simplicity reasons I will only included the first five lines of the dataset in the accompanying images. 

This is how the dataset initially looked like: 

![Google_dataset1](https://github.com/MK720-dev/Machine-Learning-with-Python-Concepts-and-Applications/blob/main/Regression/Images/Google_dataset1.png)

I then proceeded to define two new features:
 - The High Low Percentage (HL_PCT)
 - The Percentage of Change (PCT_change)
```
df['HL_PCT'] = (df['Adj. High']-df['Adj. Close'])/df['Adj. Close'] * 100
df['PCT_change'] = (df['Adj. Close']-df['Adj. Open'])/df['Adj. Open'] * 100
```
I decided to predict 1% of the entire dataframe and for that I calculated the corresponding amount of days: 
```
forecast_out = int(math.ceil(0.1*len(df)))
```
forecast_out evaluated to 343 days --> **algorithm will predict Stock prices for almost a year ahead (11.2767 months)**

I chose the Adjusted Close price **'Adj. Close'**, the High Low Percentage **'HL_PCT'**, the Percentage of Change **'PCT_change'** and the Adjusted Volume **'Adj. Volume'** to be the features of the linear regression model. 
As for the the labels that were used to train the model, I went for the Adjusted Close price 'Adj. Close' in 343 days. 
I **dropped** data samples that will be used in the predictions which represented the last 343 days of the original dataset. What we were left with was then used for training and testing.  

So the features used for training and testing were dating from 08-19-2004 to 11-10-2016 and the labels from 11-11-2016 to 03-27-2018**

After adjusting the dataset and adding the 'label' column, this what the newly generated dataset looked like:

![google_dataset2](https://github.com/MK720-dev/Machine-Learning-with-Python-Concepts-and-Applications/blob/main/Regression/Images/google_dataset2.png)

**Important:** --> It is also important to note that missing data was dealt with by setting eveyr NaN value to -99999 which makes it automatically seen as an outlier by the linear regression model
               --> Features were also rescaled and normalized to have values between -1 and 1
               
### Training and Testing 

A scikit-learn linear regression classifer was used to train and test the prediction model. 
<ins>**The model was trained to use the features from 343 days ago to predict the Adjusted Close price in 343 days.**</ins>

We used numpy's **model_selection.train_test_split()** function to divide the dataset into training and testing sets. The testing set's size was set to be 20% of the whole dataset. 

**clf.score()** was used to get the model's **accuracy**. 
--> over the span of 25 simulations, the average accuracy was **88%**.

### Predictions:

Predictions were made based on features dating from **11-11-2016 to 10-18-2017** (11-10-2016 + 343 days) and predictions were made for the dates ranging between **10-20-2017 to 09-26-2018**

Here's the final plot of the Adjusted Close prices (feature), label and the forecast results:

**Important:** note that label and forecast graphs are shifted back by 343 days

### <ins>LinearRegressionAlgorithm.py</ins>

This file contains a single variable linear regression model coded from scratched. 
The model is based on the best fit line formula. 

#### Dataset 

I created my own **randomly generated dataset** to train and test the linear model using the **create_dataset** function.

```
def create_dataset(hm, variance, step=2, correlation=False):
```

The parameters used during the dataset creation are the following:
 - hm --> how many data points do you want 
 - variance --> how variable do you want this dataset to be
 - step --> how far on average to step up the y value 
 - correlation --> do you want the data to be correlated positively or negatively or just not correlated at all 

The fucntion returns two numpy arrays one for the x values and one for the y values. 

#### Training and Testing 

##### Training: 

The best fit line's formula is **y=mx+b**, with:
  - **Slope:** $$m = \left(\bar{x} \bar{y} - \bar{xy} \over \bar{x}^2 - \bar{x^2}\right)$$
  - **y-intercept:** $$b = \bar{y} - m\bar{x}$$

##### Testing:

I used the **r squared** method to test the accuracy of the best fit line. This method makes use of the **squared error (SE)** formula:
In fact, 

$$r^2 = \left(1 - \left(SE_{\hat{y}} \over SE_{\bar{y}}\right) \right)$$

where **y hat** is represents the predicted values and **y bar** is the mean of the dataset. 

$$SE_{\hat{y}} = \sum(y - \hat{y})^2$$

and

$$SE_{\bar{y}} = \sum(y - \bar{y})^2$$

The accuracy of the model was consitent and evaluated to **93% - 94%** on average.
